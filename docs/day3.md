# Day 3

I implemented chapter "06. C Standard Library" and "07. Kernel Panic"

### 06. C Standard Library

- Functions
  - memset: Copy n bytes from src to dst
  - memcpy: Fill the first n bytes of buf with c
  - strcpy: Copy the string from src to dst
  - strcmp: Compare character to another character


### 07. Kernel Panic

This chapter implement kernel panic macro. As you experienced, Windows bluescreen is sign of kernel panic.
